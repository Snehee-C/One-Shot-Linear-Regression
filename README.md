# One-Shot-Linear-Regression
Function to automate the process of creating a linear regression model from a dataset.

# Description
We are creating the best model suitable for linear regression using the concepts of scaling, vif and fit. 
The unique part is that the code can be used for any dataset meant for linear regression but for now, the file path needs to be updated in the code itself.
The model is created without checking for linearity which could be a drawback for certain datasets.
We tested multiple other datasets from the ISLR website and a red wine dataset from Kaggle.
